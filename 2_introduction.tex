\section{Introduction}

% Introduce the need to manage complexity in designing/testing robot systems.

% Give a few of motivating examples where this might be helpful.

% Zoom in on design-analysis cycle

% Design tasks: exploring the design space. Fine-tuning designs.

% Analysis tasks: local adversarial testing, but also exploring diverse failure modes

% Closing the design/analysis gap: feeding failure modes back into the design process.
