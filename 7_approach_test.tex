\section{Approach: Design Certification} \label{section:approach_test}

Along with the Objective \& Aims section, this is the most important part of the proposal. The majority of
your time should be spent making this part of your proposal strong, direct, and completely clear. Describe
the research design and the procedures to be used to accomplish the specific aims of the project; it is
generally most effective to do this according to the same outline as in the Objective \& Aims section. Include
how the data will be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Describe any new methodology and its advantage
over existing methodologies. Discuss the potential difficulties and limitations of the proposed procedures
and alternative approaches to achieve the aims. As part of this section, provide a tentative timetable for the
project. Point out any procedures, situations or materials that may be hazardous and the precautions to be
exercised.
