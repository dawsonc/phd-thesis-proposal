\section{Future work}

% Summarize contributions to date. Frame in context of design-analysis cycle.

% Introduce areas for future work: high level grouping of research areas. Say that specific research goals in each area are in bold.

\subsection{Pushing the limits of differentiability: vision, manipulation, and beyond}

% Introduce vision and manipulation as impactful robotics applications, but say how they challenge the "differentiate-everything" mindset. Segue into how we can still apply our globalized methods to discontinuous problems.

% Discuss differentiable rendering for vision: rastering and raytracing. Lay out concrete research goal here (bold)

% Discuss differentiation concerns on manipulation. Discuss potential resolutions (contact softening; soft robotics). Lay out concrete research goal (bold).

% Discuss some cases where we can't auto-diff even if we want to (e.g. given a proprietary model). Discuss how we could get around this using a learned proxy model (but with challenges for unseen failures). Lay out concrete research goal (bold).

\subsection{Theoretical analysis}

% Recap simple theory done so far (asymptotic convergence of MCMC methods).

% Motivate more interesting theoretical questions (finite-sample; bold as a specific research goal). Suggest some avenues for approaching this problem.

\subsection{Probabilistic programming}

% Explain gap between existing approach (reparameterization trick/factor out all randomness into inputs to deterministic function) and probabilistic programming.

% Explain advantages that probprog may have for a design process.

% Formulate specific research goal.

\subsection{Static program analysis}

% Motivate continuity analysis/lipschitz analysis in terms of design/verification problems.

% Formulate specific research goal in terms of adapting existing theory of auto-Lip for practical systems.
