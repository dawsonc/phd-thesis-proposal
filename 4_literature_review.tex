\section{Background and Significance}

% Provide a high-level overview of the literature this work aims to build on.

My thesis aims to build on prior work in three distinct but related areas: differentiable and probabilistic programming, 
safety verification (both model-based and black-box), and robust and adversarial optimization. This section will review each of these fields with an eye towards framing the significance of my planned thesis contributions.

\subsection{Programs as mathematical models}

% Motivation: mathematical models are hard to come by

% Program analysis allows us to extract and exploit the structure in computer programs.

\subsubsection{Differentiable programming}

% History and objectives

% Examples of applications

% Explain forward and reverse mode differentiation, and briefly explain the math in each case

% Explain SoTA, limitations, known pathologies, and advantages/drawbacks relative to other gradient-estimation techniques.

\subsubsection{Probabilistic programming}

% History and objectives

% Examples of applications

% Overview of the theory and math

% Explain SoTA, advantages and limitations.

\subsection{Safety verification}

% general motivation, high-level problem statement.

% Split on model-based/model-free, segue

\subsubsection{Model-based safety verification}

% Historical context

% Logical models: sat, extension to SMT

% Dynamical systems: reachability, HJB, certificates

% limitations on complexity of model; segue

\subsubsection{Black-box safety verification}

% Motivation, historical context

% Black-box optimization

% RL

% Black-box inference methods

% Limitations of black-box inference

\subsection{Robust and adversarial optimization}

% Motivation: once we have safety violations, how can we use them to improve the system?

% adversarial training

% limitation: has only been explored for simple models or static tasks (e.g image classification)

\subsection{Significance of planned contributions}

% Setup contributions in two fronts

\subsubsection{Programs-as-models: a middle-ground between model-free and model-based}

% Recap limitations of model-based and model-free

% Introduce differentiable simulation as a middle-ground.

% Foreshadow claimed results: my methods are faster than model-free and yield higher-quality solutions, but more scalable than model-based.

\subsubsection{Dynamic adversarial optimization}

% Only considering static tasks is not sufficient for autonomous system verification.

% existing methods for dynamical systems are typically local and can be over-confident as a result.

% Existing optimization methods also struggle to handle multi-modal or discrete choices.
